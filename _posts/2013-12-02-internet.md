Steve Streeting, [Pendulums](http://www.stevestreeting.com/2013/12/02/pendulums/)
----------------------------

> Having slight or moderate swings in your affinity with certain aspects of work doesn’t mean you have periods of just being useless, at least if you don’t just try to force things (which can lead to disillusionment, apathy, conflict and other negative outcomes). It often means that to be most effective, it helps to be able to adjust your workload to better fit your current state. For example, I find that one of my ‘pendulums’ has exploration and creativity at one end, and nose-to-the-grindstone detail execution at the other. If you’re feeling capricious and explorative it’s great to use that to try new things, whereas other times you might just feel like cranking out implementations of existing ideas or really deep-diving into that gnarly problem you’ve been wanting to tackle for ages. Conversely if you’re trying to focus on detail work but you just keep getting distracted by other things, it can be more effective just to take a break and indulge those rather than force it – get the creative stuff out of your head and onto paper or something, and you’ll probably find yourself much more productive at the other task later.

Brian Hauer, [Microsoft's To-Do List](http://tiamat.tsotech.com/microsoft)
-------------------------------------

> Invest heavily in reducing the retail cost of large form-factor high-density displays. Aim for the [ASUS 4k PQ321](http://www.asus.com/News/L9xTPmmMwTlPMq5l) to be considered entry level on the desktop. You'll need to make up for a decade of lethargy here.

> Eschew the friction of "good enough." Seek hardware innovation opportunities by examining where good enough isn't.

> Render cygwin unnecessary by providing similar functionality out of the box. I'm on the fence about whether the full suite of Unix tools should be provided as-is or with some refreshing. These tools are useful, but they are overdue for a holistic refactoring. Is Microsoft the right group to do so? I'm not sure. But consider new, clearer names at least. And if they are renamed, be sure to provide aliases with legacy names for us old-timers.

Gary Bernhardt, [Boundaries](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries)
----------------------------

> This talk is about using simple values (as opposed to complex objects) not just for holding data, but also as the boundaries between components and subsystems. It moves through many topics: functional programming; mutability's relationship to OO; isolated unit testing with and without test doubles; and concurrency, to name some bar. The "Functional Core, Imperative Shell" screencast mentioned at the end is available as part of season 4 of the DAS catalog.

And if laughing is more your style, check out his other talk, [Wat](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat).
